**NamePending** is our iOS Project.

We are currently deciding between a Study App or Music App


## Study App User Stories
-[x] User can create their own profile with different lists of tasks/goals
These lists can contain different music playlists
User can create list of their goals
User can enable Do Not Disturb 
User can select/listen to study music
User can activate a timer in order to help them focus (Pomodoro technique)



## Random Notes and thoughts
Study App 
Downsides
Very simple, might end up finishing too early
Could focus on really good UX if finished early?
Would have to ensure that each feature of the app has equal work/focus put into it so one feature isn’t really good and the rest are lackluster

Music App
could this be for dancers to meetup and session too?

“Jam” is the group of users in that session
App will load database of the song
Load music sheet
Keep everyone in tempo
Sync BPM

Take the API of something that plays music, analyze frequency of main pitch, from there, map it 
Looks up God’s Plan
Analyzes God’s Plan
Find main frequency in that song, determines
Convert sound to chords
Frequency 

Downsides
In order for the app to be fully useful, there would need to be a good amount of users
Would require good sales pitch in order to get people to sign up
More ambitious, more time consuming so strict time commitment is required

User Stories
User can create their own profile with their music tastes
Profile can contain a sample video of the user’s work
User can see what musicians are near their location
User can message the nearby musicians

Stretch Ideas
User can rent out equipment
User can see what dancers are near their location
User can message the nearby dancers
User can sync with other users to play synced music in real time
Sync tab/chords
